            <p class="intro">Buying a razor can be a harrowing experience. From deciphering what brand you can rely on for quality and precision to selecting the ideal razor model from an endless list of options  — each offering different features, results, and guarantees — the process is enough to make one consider leaving their facial hair wild and free, Castaway-style.<br><br>
                And then there are the costs. The device itself is affordable, but the disposable parts are not. A fancy looking, grippy-rubber handle is thrown in to entice you, and you get a measly couple of cartridges with it. Then, when those wear out, you need to buy replacements to keep your supply stocked on a regular basis.<br><br>        
                Luckily, the landscape is changing when it comes to razor options, with shaving subscriptions making serious headway. All of this increased competition is a good thing as shaving is, at least for most of us, a daily requirement. The fact that we’ve gotten locked into paying hefty sums just to keep ourselves well-groomed is a travesty. A few manufacturers have taken the fight to the big boys, and they’re making the established brands a bit nervous, and for good reason. Their prices tend to be far more affordable, and the razors no longer look like Klingon rifles, but have simple, classic designs.<br><br></p>

                                    <p>Harry’s is an affordable shaving subscription service that delivers new razors to your doorstep to keep you looking fresh. It all started when Jeff Raider, co-founder of online prescription lens giant Warby Parker, teamed up with his old friend Andy Katz-Mayfield with one goal in mind: to revolutionize the way we shave. They figured it was about time someone took the initiative to bring shaving into the digital age and decided to do just that. With the Warby Parker model in mind, their idea was to take a market that is dominated by a small handful of players selling high-priced products and bring it online to help remove the friction and high costs from distribution, and give the product a sexier look through smarter design.</p>

                                            Best for men who take pride in their shaving ritual but don’t feel the need to own a $200 razor.

                                            When you subscribe to one of their shave plans, Harry’s gives you a razor, a travel-sized shave gel, and a travel blade cover for free.

                                            Plan choices are flexible depending on how often you shave (receive razors every two, three, or five months) and what you’d like from Harry’s (just razors or the gel and aftershave too). It’s easy to modify if you find there are too many or not enough products. And they send you an email two days before each shipment, so you can check-in and ensure you will receive the right amount.

For monthly subscription plans, prices range from $15 every five months for eight blades delivered to your door (for those of you who shave infrequently). Or, you can choose to bundle the eight blades and a full-sized shave gel for $21.</p>

                                        Running low on shave gel or shaving cream? Shave gel with aloe will only set you back $4, while Harry’s shaving cream with eucalyptus costs $8.

                                                <p>Formerly known as the Gillette Shave Club, Proctor & Gamble upgraded its subscription service in an aggressive effort to compete with online rivals such as Dollar Shave Club (now owned by Unilever) and Harry’s. Gillette’s research showed 41% of former subscribers complained about getting more blades than needed. Therefore, it decided to revamp (and rename) the service, giving customers “control without having to choose between convenience and flexibility, or between great quality and value.”<br><br>

                                                        Gillette On Demand engages the Generation X community by promoting a contemporary subscription model that is instinctively simple as shooting a text. No refilling of your virtual cart. No re-entering payment information. No back and forth customer service. Razor replenishment at the tip of your finger and delivered right to your door.</p>

Right in the middle is the Mach3 Turbo starting at $10. Then at the top comes the ProShield starting at $18.45. Keep in mind these prices are fixed for just the first order. Every other box moving forward comes at the original MSRP, which is $3 extra on all models. A $2 shipping charge is applied to Sensor3 boxes, whereas the other two come with free shipping. All subscriptions are auto-renewed.</p>

                                        Start by selecting a razor plan. Then choose between a service: On Demand or Set It & Forget It. The first option is only a one-time purchase. Obviously, you want a subscription, so settle for the latter. Here you can select to have razors shipped at a set time frame every 1-6 months. Move forward in creating an account by punching in an email address and creating a password. Make it a strong one or Gillette won’t grant you access. Once passed this stage, you’ll be requested to submit a billing/shipping address. Then comes credit card info and placing the order.
