            <p class="intro">Buying a razor can be a harrowing experience. From deciphering what brand you can rely on for quality and precision to selecting the ideal razor model from an endless list of options  — each offering different features, results, and guarantees — the process is enough to make one consider leaving their facial hair wild and free, Castaway-style.<br><br>
                And then there are the costs. The device itself is affordable, but the disposable parts are not. A fancy looking, grippy-rubber handle is thrown in to entice you, and you get a measly couple of cartridges with it. Then, when those wear out, you need to buy replacements to keep your supply stocked on a regular basis.<br><br>        
                Luckily, the landscape is changing when it comes to razor options, with shaving subscriptions making serious headway. All of this increased competition is a good thing as shaving is, at least for most of us, a daily requirement. The fact that we’ve gotten locked into paying hefty sums just to keep ourselves well-groomed is a travesty. A few manufacturers have taken the fight to the big boys, and they’re making the established brands a bit nervous, and for good reason. Their prices tend to be far more affordable, and the razors no longer look like Klingon rifles, but have simple, classic designs.<br><br></p>

                                    <p>Harry’s is an affordable shaving subscription service that delivers new razors to your doorstep to keep you looking fresh. It all started when Jeff Raider, co-founder of online prescription lens giant Warby Parker, teamed up with his old friend Andy Katz-Mayfield with one goal in mind: to revolutionize the way we shave. They figured it was about time someone took the initiative to bring shaving into the digital age and decided to do just that. With the Warby Parker model in mind, their idea was to take a market that is dominated by a small handful of players selling high-priced products and bring it online to help remove the friction and high costs from distribution, and give the product a sexier look through smarter design.</p>

                                            Best for men who take pride in their shaving ritual but don’t feel the need to own a $200 razor.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                            When you subscribe to one of their shave plans, Harry’s gives you a razor, a travel-sized shave gel, and a travel blade cover for free.

                                    <li>
                                            Plan choices are flexible depending on how often you shave (receive razors every two, three, or five months) and what you’d like from Harry’s (just razors or the gel and aftershave too). It’s easy to modify if you find there are too many or not enough products. And they send you an email two days before each shipment, so you can check-in and ensure you will receive the right amount.
